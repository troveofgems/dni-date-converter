    "for the D'ni people. This groundbreaking event marked a significant milestone in history, as it granted ordinary " +
    "citizens access to realms beyond their wildest dreams – all through the power of books.\n\n" +
    "This remarkable development allowed those who couldn't afford such luxuries on their own to explore vast new " +
    "worlds. While some historical accounts suggest that not everyone was entirely thrilled about this change, the " +
    "opening of the library ultimately proved to be a resounding success among the common folk.\n\n" +
    "It's worth noting that some records hint at internal debates within the guilds regarding the decision to open " +
    "the library on earth. However, the exact reasons behind these discussions remain unclear. Some speculate that " +
    "royal intervention may have played a role in the final decision, though this remains speculative.\n\n" +

    "of their ancient homeland.\n\n" +
    "This day, which could have been filled with mourning and loss, became a reason for jubilation. The D'ni " +
    "chose to view their departure from their ruined world as a liberation, rather than a tragedy. Their " +
    "decision to seal their memories of the old world from their hearts was seen as a testament to their " +
    "resilience and adaptability.\n\n" +
    "The celebration honored not just the destruction of their former home, but also the wisdom of the Great " +
    "King who had taught them to let go of the past. By embracing this new chapter in their history, " +
    "the D'ni demonstrated their capacity to find hope even in the face of catastrophic loss.\n\n" +
    "Moreover, this day marked the beginning of a new era – one where they could continue their lives on earth, " +

    "powerful symbol of transformation and renewal, reminding future generations of the strength and determination " +
    "that had carried their people through such trying times.\n\n" +
    "In essence, what could have been a day of mourning turned into a celebration of life, hope, and the ability to" +

    "D'ni's permanent home, effectively severing ties with their ancient world. This decree was met with both " +
    "acceptance and perhaps some reluctance, as it meant leaving behind everything they had ever known.\n\n" +
    "The Great King's prophecies were said to be numerous and profound, inscribed in books that have yet to " +
    "be discovered. These prophetic writings were believed to hold the keys to understanding the future and " +
    "guiding the D'ni people through the trials ahead.\n\n" +
    "However, the passage of time has taken its toll on these ancient texts. While the prophecies " +
